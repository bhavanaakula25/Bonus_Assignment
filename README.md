## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This assignment is divided into two parts:

1. **Question Answering with Transformers** â€“ Utilizing Hugging Face's `transformers` library to create a question-answering system using both default and custom pre-trained models.
2. **Digit-Class Controlled Image Generation using Conditional GAN (cGAN)** â€“ Modifying a basic GAN to conditionally generate MNIST digits based on class labels (0â€“9).

## âœ… Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install transformers torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## ðŸ“– Part 1: Question Answering with Transformers

### Task Summary:

- Used `transformers.pipeline` for question answering.
- Tested with:
  - **Default pre-trained model**
  - **Custom model**: `deepset/roberta-base-squad2`
- Created and tested on a custom context with two questions.

### Sample Output:

- Example Answer: `'Charles Babbage'`
- Confidence Score: `> 0.70`
- Includes valid `start` and `end` indices

## ðŸŽ¨ Part 2: Conditional GAN (cGAN) for MNIST

### Task Summary:

- Modified GAN architecture to condition generator and discriminator on digit labels.
- Input:
  - Generator: Noise vector + label embedding
  - Discriminator: Image + label embedding
- Trained on the MNIST dataset.
- Generated one row of digits for labels 0â€“9.

### Visual Results:

- Each row of images corresponds to digits 0 through 9.
- Output digit shape: 28x28
- Training shows improved label-specific digit generation.

## ðŸ§  Short Answers

**Q1: How does a Conditional GAN differ from a Vanilla GAN?**  
A Conditional GAN takes an additional label as input, allowing it to generate outputs based on class control.  
**Real-world Example**: Generating specific clothing types (e.g., shirts, pants) using labeled fashion images.

**Q2: What does the Discriminator learn in an image-to-image GAN? Why is pairing important?**  
It learns to distinguish real vs. fake image pairs (e.g., sketches â†’ photos).  
Pairing is crucial to ensure the generator learns correct mapping and not just produce random outputs.
